This is a Jupyter notebook designed to accompany Leonard Susskind's Statistical Mechanics course, 
from the website http://theoreticalminimum.com/courses/statistical-mechanics/2013/spring

I have attempted to write the major mathematical work in Latex, including some small experiments in Python 3.6.
This is designed for you to try experiments out, and to try to clarify the mathematical work/proofs.

An overview of major concepts by lecture has been added at the top level directory:
https://github.com/galenwilkerson/statistical-mechanics/blob/master/major%20concepts.pdf

I've recently added an Ising Model Sandbox, feel free to modify as you like.

Based on this:

Wilensky, U. (2003). NetLogo Ising model. http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/Ising. Center for Connected Learning and Computer-Based Modeling, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL.

Any errors are exercises for the reader!  (You learn by doing, not just by reading.)

Enjoy!
